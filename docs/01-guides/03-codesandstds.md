# Codes and Standards

$steelsnakes$ references codes and standards divided by **region**. Each region contains **specification** standards that contain steel profile properties and dimensions, and **design** standards that contain design rules and verification checks.

## Current coverage (March 21, 2026)

- **EU / UK / US**: The packaged datasets already cover universal sections, beams, channels, angles, hollow sections, and piles; UK/US checks for ULS, stability, classification, and LRFD are available with more metadata to be completed.
- **IN**: IS 808:2021 data ingestion is in progress; clamp-to-table helpers and clause references are on the roadmap (look for TODO markers in `src/steelsnakes/IN/checks/__init__.py`).
- **AU / NZ / JP / MX / SA / CN / CA / KR**: These regions remain on the roadmap. SectionType enums already reference the expected series (`AS/NZS`, `JIS`, `NMX`, etc.), so adding the data is mostly a matter of aligning the JSON assets and connectors.

## 🇪🇺 `EU` - European Union

The European Union uses the Eurocode suite of standards. Countries in the EU may have their own **National Annexes** that modify some of the design rules. $steelsnakes$ currently does not implement any National Annexes other than the UK NA in the `UK` section.

## 🇬🇧 `UK` - United Kingdom

The United Kingdom the Eurocode suite of standards with the UK National Annex. The UK National Annex modifies some of the design rules in the base Eurocode standards. Formerly used the BS 5950 for design and BS 4-1 for section properties, but these have been withdrawn.
