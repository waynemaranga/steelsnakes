# Codes and Standards

$steelsnakes$ references codes and standards divided by **region**. Each region contains **specification** standards that contain steel profile properties and dimensions, and **design** standards that contain design rules and verification checks.

## ｪｺ `EU` - European Union

The European Union uses the Eurocode suite of standards. Countries in the EU may have their own **National Annexes** that modify some of the design rules. $steelsnakes$ currently does not implement any National Annexes other than the UK NA in the `UK` section.

## ｬｧ `UK` - United Kingdom

The United Kingdom the Eurocode suite of standards with the UK National Annex. The UK National Annex modifies some of the design rules in the base Eurocode standards. Formerly used the BS 5950 for design and BS 4-1 for section properties, but these have been withdrawn.
