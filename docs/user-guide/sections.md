# Sections

- Sections i.e cross-sections of steel members.
- Recall basic statics: structural members are prismatic longitudinally.

## Section Types

### I-sections

Primarily beams and columns.
TODO: Explain why I-sections are more efficient in flexure/bending than rectangular sections due to higher second moment of area.

### Channels

### Angles

### Hollow sections

### Pipes

## Regional Standards

TODO: Explain that though given standards are region-specific, many countries adopt other countries' standards with varying levels of modification, e.g UK standards are a blend of EU and older British standards (BS), Japan adopts US standards, Saudi Arabia adopts US standards but UAE adopts EU standards.

TODO: Add tables of standards with names and reliable links, as well as summary descriptions.
